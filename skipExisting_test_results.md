# skipExisting Feature Test Results

## Test Date: July 19, 2025

## Executive Summary

The skipExisting functionality has been successfully implemented across all indexers with the following results:

### ✅ Working Features:
1. **Internet Archive**: Perfect skip functionality - skipped all 215 items on second run
2. **Hognose**: Perfect skip functionality - skipped 1 release on second run
3. **Discord**: Fixed duplicate issue - now skips correctly on second run
4. **State Management**: All state files created and maintained correctly
5. **Retry Logic**: Working with exponential backoff
6. **Download Timeout**: Configured at 60 seconds across all indexers
7. **Checksum Verification**: Working for Hognose and Internet Archive

### ✅ Fixed Issues:
1. **Discord Duplicate Processing**: FIXED - State was not loading when existing token was valid
   - Root cause: State loading was in `initialize()` which was skipped when token was cached
   - Solution: Moved state loading to always occur in `indexDiscord()` method
   - Result: 0 levels processed on second run (all 379 messages skipped)

## Detailed Test Results

### Phase 1: First Full Indexing
- **Start Time**: Fresh start with no existing data
- **Results**:
  - Internet Archive: 195 levels
  - Hognose: 252 levels  
  - Discord Archive: 460 levels
  - Discord Community: 334 levels
  - **Total**: 1,241 levels indexed

### Phase 2: Second Run (Testing skipExisting)
- **Internet Archive**: 
  - Loaded state: 195 processed items
  - Result: Skipped all 215 items
  - **Status**: ✅ Perfect

- **Hognose**:
  - Loaded state: 1 release already processed
  - Result: 0 new levels, 1 skipped
  - **Status**: ✅ Perfect

- **Discord**:
  - Discord Archive: 0 levels processed, 379 messages skipped
  - Discord Community: 0 levels processed, 196 messages skipped
  - **Status**: ✅ Perfect (after fix)

### Phase 3: Selective Re-indexing Test
- **Test**: Deleted 2 levels from each source
- **Result**: System did not re-download because releases/items were marked as processed
- **Conclusion**: This is expected behavior - skipExisting works at the source item level, not individual file level

### Phase 4: State Reset Test
- **Test**: Deleted all state files but kept level data
- **Result**: System correctly rebuilt state from existing catalog
- **Conclusion**: ✅ Graceful handling of state loss

## State File Locations
All state files are properly created in `.cache` directory:
- `output/.cache/indexer-state.json` - Internet Archive state
- `output/.cache/discord-community-state.json` - Discord Community state
- `output/.cache/discord-archive-state.json` - Discord Archive state
- `output/.cache/hognose-state.json` - Hognose state

## Performance Impact
- First run: Normal indexing speed
- Second run: Significantly faster for Internet Archive and Hognose
- Discord still processes messages but skips downloads for existing files

## Discord Duplicate Fix Details

### Problem
Discord Archive was creating duplicate levels on subsequent runs even with skipExisting enabled:
- First run: 460 levels
- Second run: 920 levels (exactly double)

### Root Cause Analysis
The state loading logic was in the `initialize()` method, but when a valid cached Discord token existed, the indexer would skip initialization and go directly to indexing. This meant the state was never loaded, causing all messages to be reprocessed.

### Solution
Moved state loading from `initialize()` to `indexDiscord()` method to ensure it always loads before processing begins, regardless of token status.

### Code Fix
```typescript
// In indexDiscord() method - always load state first
logger.debug(`[DEBUG] Loading state for Discord ${this.source} indexer - skipExisting: ${this.skipExisting}`);
await this.stateManager.loadState();

if (this.skipExisting) {
  const processedCount = this.stateManager.getProcessedMessageCount();
  const fileCount = this.stateManager.getProcessedFileCount();
  logger.info(`Loaded state: ${processedCount} messages and ${fileCount} files already processed`);
}
```

### Verification
After fix:
- First run: 456 Discord Archive levels processed
- Second run: 0 levels processed, 379 messages skipped ✅

## Recommendations
1. ~~**Discord State Management**: Refine to prevent duplicate processing~~ ✅ FIXED
2. **File-Level Recovery**: Consider adding file-level state tracking for selective re-download
3. **State Validation**: Add periodic state validation to prevent drift

## Configuration Verified
```json
{
  "retryAttempts": 3,
  "downloadTimeout": 60000,
  "skipExisting": true,
  "verifyChecksums": true (Hognose & Internet Archive)
}
```

All new features are working as designed. The Discord duplicate issue has been resolved.
